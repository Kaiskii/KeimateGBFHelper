**CSS**
* Superior Font

* Improved, Slimmer Scrollbar
* Highlight and copy Raid/Coop code

**JS**
* Press 'A' during combat to simulate clicking on the Attack button
* Press 'C' during combat to simulate toggling of the CA button
* Press 'R' whilst traversing through inventory weapons/summons to reset "+Mark" bonuses
* Show CD timers of skills without clicking on individual characters
* Press 'Spacebar' to accept transactional actions;
  - Trading
  - Upgrading Weapons
  - Uncapping Weapons
  - Buying
  - Accept/Ok

# How to import:
1. Download the current [JS](https://github.com/Nirvaxstiel/GBF-Helper/blob/master/gbfhelper.js) and [CSS](https://github.com/Nirvaxstiel/GBF-Helper/blob/master/gbfhelper.css) files: 
1. Install any Extension that allows injection of user-created Javascript and CSS
2. Paste the code
3. Profit!

# Example of extensions:
* [User Javascript and CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld)


# Existing Problems:
* Quick Skill cool down timers only update on page load
* Co-op/Co-op Raid code opens Raid information dialog before copying.
